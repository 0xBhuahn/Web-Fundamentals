### DNS (Domain Name System)
> DNS provides a simple way for us to communicate with devices on the internet without remembering complex numbers (Like IP Address 104.27.32.226). 

> it's not exactly convenient to remember this complicated set of numbers, and that's where DNS can help. So instead of remembering 104.26.10.229, you can remember Facebook.com instead. For Example
